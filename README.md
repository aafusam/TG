## Telegram Messaging Bot

Send messages via Telegram Bot in your browser.

This app uses an API [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for fetching received messages and for sending messages to a user.

The user can enter bot token and chat ID to initiate the messaging and can post as well as receive messages through the Telegram API.

[Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) allow developers to fetch and post messages to a user and offer many more resources. 

## Optimizations
While improving this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. Add support for multiple cryptocurrencies with same keywords
   2. Implement more API endpoints
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned how to develop an API, create documentation for it and serve content when the API gets a request. I learned how to integrate an API into a project and how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to create a simple API-based project. I learned about API management and how it can help in the growth of  businesses.
